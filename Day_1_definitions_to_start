1. Subnet
A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Subnets are used to divide a VPC into smaller segments. Each subnet is associated with a specific availability zone (a single data center within an AWS region).

Public Subnet: Has a route to an internet gateway, allowing resources within it to be accessed from the internet.
Private Subnet: Lacks a direct route to the internet, isolating resources from public access.
Subnets help segregate resources to improve security and manageability.
2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
A VPC is a logically isolated network within AWS. It allows you to launch resources (like EC2 instances, RDS databases) in a customizable virtual network. You can:

Define your own IP address range using CIDR.
Create subnets.
Configure route tables, gateways, and security rules.
It gives full control over the network environment, enabling secure and flexible architectures.
3. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR defines IP address ranges in a more efficient way than traditional classes. A CIDR block specifies an IP range using a combination of IP address and prefix length.

Example: 10.0.0.0/16
10.0.0.0 is the base IP.
/16 means the first 16 bits are for the network part, leaving the rest for host addresses.
CIDR is used in VPCs to allocate private IP ranges.
4. IP Address
An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. AWS assigns:

Private IPs: For communication within a VPC (not accessible from the internet).
Public IPs: For resources needing internet access.
AWS also offers Elastic IPs, which are static public IPs you can allocate and attach to resources.
5. Route
A route is a rule that determines where network traffic is directed. For example:

Traffic destined for 0.0.0.0/0 (all addresses) is routed to an internet gateway for public access.
Routes are defined in route tables.
6. Route Table
A route table is a set of rules (routes) that determine the traffic flow in a VPC.

Each subnet must be associated with a route table.
A default route table is created for a VPC.
Example Rules:
Route traffic to local VPC subnets.
Route internet traffic to an internet gateway.
7. Gateway
A gateway provides a connection between your VPC and another network (e.g., the internet or on-premises networks).
Types of gateways:

Internet Gateway (IGW): Enables internet access for resources in a public subnet.
NAT Gateway: Allows private subnet resources to access the internet (e.g., for software updates) without exposing them to inbound traffic.
Virtual Private Gateway: Connects a VPC to an on-premises network via VPN.
8. NAT (Network Address Translation)
A NAT Gateway or NAT Instance allows instances in private subnets to access the internet for tasks like software updates while preventing inbound internet traffic.

NAT Gateway: Fully managed, scalable service.
NAT Instance: A manually managed EC2 instance configured for NAT.
9. Security Group
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for AWS resources like EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

Stateful: If traffic is allowed in, the response is automatically allowed out.
Rules define protocols (e.g., HTTP, SSH), ports, and allowed IPs.
Example: Allow inbound SSH traffic from 203.0.113.0/24.
10. NACL (Network Access Control List)
A Network Access Control List (NACL) is an additional security layer at the subnet level.

Stateless: Each direction (inbound/outbound) must be explicitly allowed.
Rules: Numbered and processed in order; the first match determines the action (allow/deny).
Example: Block traffic from a malicious IP range.
11. Peering Connection
A VPC peering connection establishes a direct, private connection between two VPCs.

Traffic stays within AWS’s private network, ensuring low latency and security.
Useful for sharing resources across VPCs in the same or different accounts.
12. Transitive Peering
Transitive peering refers to routing traffic between two VPCs through a third, peered VPC. AWS does not support transitive routing natively. To enable transitive-like connections:

Use Transit Gateway: A fully managed service to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
Create separate peering connections for direct VPC communication.
Additional Key Concepts:
Elastic IP (EIP): A static, public IP address that can be assigned to AWS resources. It allows consistent IP use even if the instance is stopped and restarted.

Transit Gateway: A centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and VPNs. It simplifies network management for large-scale architectures.

VPN (Virtual Private Network): Connects your on-premises network securely to your VPC.

Direct Connect: Provides a dedicated physical connection from your on-premises network to AWS for consistent and high-speed data transfer.

 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
What it is: DHCP is a network management protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configurations (like DNS server addresses, default gateways) to devices on a network.
In AWS:
AWS automatically provides DHCP services for resources in a VPC.
You can configure a DHCP options set to specify the domain name and DNS servers for your VPC.
Example use: Assigning private IPs to instances in a subnet.
2. DNS (Domain Name System)
What it is: DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1) so computers can communicate.
In AWS:
DNS is managed by Amazon Route 53, a scalable and highly available DNS service.
Every VPC has an internal DNS resolver to translate domain names to IPs within the VPC.
Public and private hosted zones can be used to manage DNS records for internet-facing and internal domains.
Key Features:
Route traffic using custom domain names.
Configure DNS failover and load balancing.
3. DNS Gateway
What it is: This term generally refers to a DNS resolver or service that acts as a "gateway" to process DNS queries.
In AWS:
A VPC has a built-in DNS resolver (at the default IP 169.254.169.253) that enables resources to resolve domain names.
For custom configurations, Route 53 Resolver provides DNS forwarding between on-premises networks and AWS.
4. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
What it is: EC2 is a core AWS service that provides resizable virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. It allows users to run applications, host websites, and perform computing tasks with customizable resources.
Key Features:
Instance Types: EC2 instances come in various types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or networking.
Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
Elastic Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
AMI (Amazon Machine Images): Pre-configured templates for launching instances with operating systems and applications.
Networking with EC2:
Each EC2 instance is launched in a VPC and assigned an IP address (private or public).
Security Groups and NACLs are used to control traffic.
Elastic IPs provide a persistent public IP for an instance.
Storage: EC2 instances typically use Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes for persistent storage or Instance Store for ephemeral storage.
Summary
AWS integrates these networking and compute concepts seamlessly:

DHCP dynamically assigns IPs in VPCs.
DNS handles domain name resolution using Route 53 and VPC’s internal resolver.
DNS Gateway refers to mechanisms like Route 53 Resolver for forwarding or resolving domain queries.
EC2 provides scalable, on-demand compute instances that rely on these networking services for efficient operation.
